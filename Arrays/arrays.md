# Arrays

### What are Arrays : 

In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

* The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address , foundation address or the base address. 
* Tuples or vectors are another names in some of the languages that define the same structure as an array. 
* Arrays are also used to implement other data structres like lists and strings. 
* Vector processors are specific processors that are often optimised for array operations. 
* Arrays are often useful because of the capability of fast index calculations and accessing data when it is stored in a sequential or sorted manner. Index calculation for arrays can be done at the run time. 
* John Von Neumann wrote the first array-sorting program(merge sort) in 1945, during the building of the first stored-program computer. 
* Array indexing was originally done by self-modifying code and later used index registers and indirect addressing. 

### Applications of arrays :

Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors (single-dimension arrays) and matrices(multi-dimensional arrays), as well as other kind of rectangular tables. 

  **Arrays are used to implement other data structures , such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings etc.** 

  * Array based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient, requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity, compared to tree-based data structures.
